    title: 'Bimbo Bakeries will lay off 138 and shutter its San Antonio bakery',
    content:
        'Bimbo Bakeries USA, part of Mexico’s Grupo Bimbo, which bills itself as the world’s largest bakery with operations in 35 countries, will shutter its San Antonio bakery and distribution center this fall, laying off 138 workers.\n\nBimbo owns more than 100 bakery brands, many well known, including Sara Lee, Tia Rosa, Entenmann’s, Mrs. Baird’s, Thomas’ and Boboli. It plans to also close two facilities in New York, affecting another 131 employees.\n\nThe company notified the Texas Workforce Commission of the coming layoffs in San Antonio on Friday, listing Oct. 5 as the day layoffs would go into effect.\n\n“After careful analysis and consideration, we have made the difficult decision to close the San Antonio, TX bakery this fall,” said Bimbo Bakeries USA in a statement. “We will transition production to bakeries in our network that are better equipped to support our future growth.”\n\nThe company expressed gratitude for its employees and said it was committed to providing them with “resources and support to ease their transitions.”\n\nThe latest closures follow three others earlier this year in Nebraska, New Mexico and Quebec, part of the company’s North American restructuring.\n\n“The food industry has been facing consumption headwinds from consumer pressure,” said Daniel Servitje, then the company’s chairman and chief executive officer in an earnings call in February (Bimbo is traded on the Mexican Stock Exchange).\n\nServitje stepped down in April, after growing Grupo Bimbo to eight times its size when he took the helm in 1997. The company was founded in 1945 by his father. Servitje now serves as executive chairman. The company has been named “one of the world’s most ethical companies several times, and last year was named a “world’s best company” by Time magazine.\n\nEarlier this summer, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration told Bimbo to stop using labels that say its products contain potentially dangerous allergens when they don’t, according to the Associated Press. The warnings followed inspections in 2023 at Bimbo plants in Arizona and Kansas that make Sara Lee and Brownberry breads.\n\nIn 2022, Bimbo-employed bakery distributor drivers sued the company alleging they were misclassified as independent contractors, rather than employees, and were owed back pay. Last year, the U.S. Labor Department said the federal labor standards act would not allow Bimbo to file a countersuit against the drivers.',

        'The Texas GOP says it’s time to limit hemp that gets you high. The industry wants regulation.',
    content:
        'The Texas Legislature doesn’t meet again until January, but a fight is already heating up over the state’s estimated \$8 billion consumable hemp industry, pitting a usually business-friendly GOP against veterans organizations and others who say these products are used responsibly by millions and should be regulated — but not banned.\n\nWhat neither side disputes is that these products get users high, something lawmakers didn’t account for when they penned the 2019 law that legalized the hemp industry in Texas.\n\nAt the time, CBD was the most common hemp-derived consumable, and it is generally not intoxicating or habit-forming.\n\nBut as the industry grew, it discovered that other intoxicating compounds could be coaxed from hemp, leading to an explosion of legal products that offer users a similar high to marijuana. Under both current federal and state law, these products, which include candies, drinks, vape pens and even hemp flower, can legally be sold to minors, be shipped across state lines and purchased with credit cards.\n\n“It looks like we inadvertently made cannabis legal in Texas,” said state Sen. José Menéndez (D-San Antonio), who favors additional regulation of the industry as opposed to an outright ban. Doing so, he said, could bring Texas millions in tax revenue, which could be used to “fix public schools, fix our roads.”\n\nA majority of his colleagues across the aisle, however, seem to support Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who made banning these products one of his interim legislative priorities.\n\nBut as demand for these products in states like Texas that have not legalized marijuana has exploded, the industry is fighting back, asking for additional targeted regulation that would keep it away from children and teens.\n\n“A state legislature is meant to reflect the will of the people,” said Cynthia Cabrera, director of the recently formed Texas Hemp Business Council. “Given the size of the market in Texas, it’s obvious that people want these products.”\n\nIt doesn’t appear pollsters have asked Texans where they stand on hemp-derived products. According to a 2024 Texas Lyceum poll, 73% support either full legalization or decriminalization of marijuana. An even higher percentage support expanding the use of medical marijuana.\n\nHemp-derived cannabis products offer an increasing number of Texans relaxation and pain relief, and an alternative to alcohol, opioids and other pharmaceuticals, Cabrera said. The state’s “compassionate use” program, while it has expanded in recent years, remains limited to those with certain conditions.\n\nAccording to an economic impact study performed in 2022, Texas’ “cannabusiness” revenue surpassed \$8 billion that year, and supported roughly 50,000 jobs. Hemp-derived product manufacturers, the report states, have invested more than \$1 billion in infrastructure throughout the state.\n\nBanning intoxicating hemp products will destroy this emerging statewide market, advocates say, but it will not affect demand, which will simply be driven underground, making products less safe.\n\nThat’s why the Hemp Business Council backs measures like age restrictions, child-proof packaging and setbacks, much like alcohol sales, which restricts certain businesses from selling near schools.\n\nPatrick Brantley, a veteran and owner of Green Haven Cannabis Co., which recently opened its third location in San Antonio, said the stores’ customers include soccer moms, seniors and veterans as well as those who previously bought illegal products “on the street.” The stores do not sell to minors, Brantley said.\n\nHis latest shop, in Alamo Heights, eschews the more typical look of many retailers, which lean into marijuana culture with psychedelic decor and pot leaf iconography. Instead, his dark wood-paneled shop offers a small, curated set of products sold by “budtenders” who educate a steady stream of the hemp-curious.\n\n“The stigma around it is way down,” he said.\n\nBrantley, who earned an MBA at Texas A&M University-San Antonio and said his goal is to become “the number one cannabis company in Texas,” employs eight of the estimated 50,000 Texans who work in the state’s hemp industry, which in 2022 paid \$1.6 billion in wages.',

        'Paramount Global announces it will cut 15% of U.S. workforce, shares rise on second-quarter earnings',
    content:
        'Paramount Global is cutting 15% of its U.S. workforce, or about 2,000 jobs, part of a broader cost-cutting plan as it prepares for a merger with Skydance Media.\n\nParamount has identified \$500 million in cost savings, which include the head count reductions, as part of \$2 billion in synergies related to its transaction with Skydance. The job cuts, which will begin in the coming weeks and largely conclude by year end, will target the company’s marketing and communications department and employees who work in finance, legal, technology and other support functions, the company said during its earnings conference call Thursday.\n\nParamount agreed to a merger with Skydance Media last month. That deal includes a 45-day go-shop period — in which a special committee of Paramount’s board could find another buyer — that concludes later this month.\n\nMeanwhile, earnings surged as the company’s streaming division swung to an unexpected profit — the first time Paramount has announced a profitable quarter for its direct-to-consumer business.\n\nShares climbed more than 5% in after-hours trading Thursday.\n\nHere’s how Paramount performed in the quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nSecond-quarter revenue dropped 11% and missed analyst estimates as licensing, TV advertising and cable subscription sales dropped.\n\nThe revenue drop was the largest miss compared to analyst estimates since February 2020, according to LSEG data. Paramount attributed the miss to a decline in TV licensing revenue, which can be difficult for analysts to model given their start and end dates.\n\nParamount+ revenue grew 46% on year-over-year subscriber growth and higher prices. Paramount+ customers decreased 2.8 million from last quarter to 68 million as the company unwound a Korean partnership deal with entertainment company CJ ENM’s Tving streaming platform.\n\nParamount’s streaming division turned a profit for the quarter of \$26 million after losing \$424 million a year ago. Analysts had estimated a loss of \$265 million this quarter.\n\nParamount reaffirmed it’s on track to reach U.S. profitability for Paramount+ in 2025. The streaming service has raised prices and cut content spend.\n\nParamount’s quarterly profit is helped by not having an NFL licensing charge for the period, which will kick in later in the year.\n\nShares have slumped 31% so far this year amid declines among cable subscribers and a soft linear TV advertising market.\n\nParamount also took a \$6 billion one-time impairment charge associated with the decline in its cable networks. It comes on the heels of a \$9.1 billion write-down from peer Warner Bros. Discovery on Wednesday.',

        'As inflation fury lingers, politicians join customers in pushing companies to cut prices',
    content:
        'Expensive Big Mac meals and fears of surge pricing at grocery stores have put food chains and consumer product companies in politicians’ crosshairs.\n\nWalmart, McDonald’s and Kroger are just a few of the companies that have found themselves in the debate over high inflation in the 2024 election.\n\nOn Monday, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bob Casey, D-Pa., sent a letter to Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen that questioned the grocer’s rollout of electronic shelf labels, arguing the technology could make it easier to increase the price of high-demand items. The letter also noted that the supermarket chain could become bigger, depending on whether it closes its pending \$24.6 billion acquisition of rival Albertsons.\n\nDemocrats — particularly those like Casey who are trying to win races in competitive swing states — are trying to capitalize on frustration against companies over inflation. The moves follow years of Republican attempts to blame the price hikes on President Joe Biden, who has also criticized corporations for what he called greedy tactics.\n\nFor instance, an X account run by House Republican leadership criticized Biden’s economic policies in late May by listing some of the popular fast-food menu items that customers now pay more for at McDonald’s, Chick-fil-A and Taco Bell. (The source of the data is unclear, and McDonald’s has denied that its average prices have risen that much.)\n\nOn the presidential campaign trail now, both Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump have pledged to fight persistent inflation, while blaming different causes.\n\nHarris has said during rallies that she’ll fight “price gouging” by companies. At his own rallies, Trump has criticized Biden administration policies and said he’ll end the “inflation nightmare.”\n\nThe fact that both parties have made fighting inflation a key campaign plank shows how much the cost of food, gas and shelter is on the minds of consumers across income levels, regions and political parties. The criticism could also add to the pressure companies face to show they can lower prices or offer value.\n\nInflation has cooled from decades-high levels, with groceries up about 1.1% year over year as of June, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But food at home is up 26.2% since June 2019 and food away from home, which mostly includes restaurant meals, is up 27.2% in the same period.\n\nAmericans ranked inflation and prices as their most important issue in the latest The Economist/YouGov poll, which included a representative sample of roughly 1,600 U.S. adult citizens. That was ahead of other themes that have come up on the campaign trail, including immigration, climate change and health care.\n\nPromising to tackle higher everyday costs is a safe campaign issue during contentious times, said Cait Lamberton, a professor of marketing at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.\n\n“There isn’t much we can agree on, right? But we can agree on that,” she said.\n\nIt’s often tricky to make a case for how a policy will affect voters’ lives. That’s not the case with the cost of necessities.\n\n“There’s a very nice, easy, causal connection between voting for a person and believing my grocery bill can go down,” she said.',

        'Yum Brands reports mixed results as Pizza Hut and KFC same-store sales fall',
    content:
        'Yum Brands on Tuesday reported a mixed quarter as both Pizza Hut and KFC reported declining same-store sales.\n\n“The impacts from the Middle East conflict, in addition to a more cost-conscious consumer, have presented headwinds to same-store sales,” Yum CEO David Gibbs told analysts on the company’s conference call.\n\nHe added that sales trends have improved in the U.S. compared with the prior quarter, thanks to value meals such as Pizza Hut’s \$7 Deal Lovers.\n\nHere’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: \$1.35 adjusted vs. \$1.33 expected\n\nRevenue: \$1.76 billion vs. \$1.8 billion expected\n\nYum reported second-quarter net income of \$367 million, or \$1.28 per share, down from \$418 million, or \$1.46 per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding items, the company earned \$1.35 per share.\n\nNet sales rose 4% to \$1.76 billion, fueled by new restaurant openings. Yum’s same-store sales fell 1% in the quarter as both Pizza Hut and KFC reported same-store sales declines of 3%.\n\nKFC’s U.S. restaurants continued to struggle, with domestic same-store sales shrinking 5%. And although the chicken chain’s system sales picked up this quarter in China, its largest market, KFC’s overall international same-store sales fell 3%.\n\nPizza Hut’s U.S. same-store sales decreased 1%, while its international same-store sales declined 4%.\n\nTaco Bell, the crown jewel of Yum’s portfolio, saw its same-store sales increase 5% in the quarter. The chain’s footprint is largely concentrated in the U.S., where its reputation for value has helped it weather the pullback in consumer spending. Taco Bell’s same-store sales grew across all income cohorts, Gibbs said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Yum announced plans to expand its rollout of artificial intelligence across Taco Bell drive-thru lanes to hundreds of its U.S. restaurants by the end of the year.\n\nRoughly 200 of Yum’s restaurants are temporarily closed across the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia, according to Chief Financial Officer Chris Turner. Some of those locations may reopen as soon as later this month, but he acknowledged the risk that some could close permanently if the conflict worsens.',

        'Carvana beats Wall Street’s second-quarter expectations, guides toward record year',
    content:
        'Shares of Carvana jumped as much as 14% during after-hours trading Wednesday as the company topped Wall Street’s expectations for the second quarter and disclosed expectations for record adjusted earnings of at least \$1 billion for 2024.\n\nHere is how the company performed in the second quarter, compared to average estimates compiled by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 14 cents vs. a loss of 7 cents expected\n\nRevenue: \$3.41 billion vs. \$3.24 billion expected\n\nThe beats were driven by Carvana’s retail vehicle sales of more than 101,400 units during the quarter, up 32.5% compared to the second quarter of 2023.\n\nConcurrently with its earnings release, Carvana said in a separate filing that it would make an at-the-market offering worth approximately \$1 billion in stock, 35 million shares or so.\n\nThe company’s gross profit per unit, or GPU, which is closely watched by investors, was \$7,049, up \$529 from a year earlier.\n\nCarvana expects 2024 to be a record year for the used-car retailer following the results, including projecting adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of between \$1 billion and \$1.2 billion for the full year 2024, an increase from \$339 million in 2023.\n\nCarvana’s guidance signals expectations for a strong second half of the year. The company said it expects a sequential increase in retail vehicle sales during the third quarter compared to the prior three months.\n\n“Looking forward, our business still has a lot of untapped potential. And our team is still unreasonable. We see opportunities to improve significantly from here over time,” Carvana CEO and co-founder Ernie Garcia said Wednesday in a joint shareholder letter with Chief Financial Officer Mark Jenkins.\n\nThe company’s previous guidance for the year included a “sequential increase in adjusted EBITDA” for the second half of the year, but did not supply a dollar amount.\n\nIf Carvana meets its 2024 earnings target, it will mark the company’s third annual EBITDA profit, including 2023′s record of \$339 million.\n\nCarvana’s second-quarter net income was \$48 million and net income margin was 1.4%. Adjusted EBITDA was \$355 million and adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.4%, both company records.\n\nThe second-quarter results continue a massive turnaround for Carvana following Wall Street fears of bankruptcy for the company in early 2022.',

        'This AI-powered financial advisor has quickly gained \$20 billion in assets',
    content:
        'An automated financial advisor called PortfolioPilot has quickly gained \$20 billion in assets in a possible preview of how disruptive artificial intelligence could be for the wealth management industry.\n\nThe service has added more than 22,000 users since its launch two years ago, according to Alexander Harmsen, co-founder of Global Predictions, which launched the product.\n\nThe San Francisco-based startup raised \$2 million this month from investors including Morado Ventures and the NEA Angel Fund to fund its growth, CNBC has learned.\n\nThe world’s largest wealth management firms have rushed to implement generative AI after the arrival of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, rolling out services that augment human financial advisors with meeting assistants and chatbots. But the wealth management industry has long feared a future where human advisors are no longer necessary, and that possibility seems closer with generative AI, which uses large language models to create human-sounding responses to questions.\n\nStill, the advisor-led wealth management space, with giants including Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, has grown over the past decade even amid the advent of robo-advisors like Betterment and Wealthfront. At Morgan Stanley, for instance, advisors manage \$4.4 trillion in assets, far more than the \$1.2 trillion managed in its self-directed channel.\n\nMany providers, whether human or robo-advisor, end up putting clients into similar portfolios, said Harmsen, 32, who previously cofounded an autonomous drone software company called Iris Automation.\n\n“People are fed up with cookie-cutter portfolios,” Harmsen told CNBC. “They really want opinionated insights; they want personalized recommendations. If we think about next-generation advice, I think it’s truly personalized, and you get to control how involved you are.”\n\nAI-generated report cards\n\nThe startup uses generative AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic and Meta’s Llama, meshing it with machine learning algorithms and traditional finance models for more than a dozen purposes throughout the product, including for forecasting and assessing user portfolios, Harmsen said.\n\nWhen it comes to evaluating portfolios, Global Predictions focuses on three main factors: whether investment risk levels match the user’s tolerance; risk-adjusted returns; and resilience against sharp declines, he said.\n\nUsers can get a report card-style grade of their portfolio by connecting their investment accounts or manually inputting their stakes into the service, which is free; a \$29 per month “Gold” account adds personalized investment recommendations and an AI assistant.\n\n',

        'WASHINGTON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Boeing’s (BA.N), opens new tab new CEO Kelly Ortberg said on Thursday he would be based in the planemaker’s birthplace Seattle, moving closer to the factory floor to rein in a safety crisis.\n\nOrtberg\'s confirmation of earlier reports that he would move to Puget Sound, Washington, rather than Boeing\'s corporate headquarters in Washington D.C., follows months of pressure on the company to reconnect with its industrial roots after missing bolts led to a door plug falling off a 737 MAX jet in mid-air in January.\n\nOrtberg, 64, will spend part of Thursday, his first day on the job, meeting workers who produce the company\'s strong-selling 737 MAX jet at a factory in the Seattle suburb Renton, as he faces the steep task of "restoring trust," according to a message to employees.\n\n"Because what we do is complex, I firmly believe that we need to get closer to the production lines and development programs across the company," he wrote in the letter.\n\nThe former boss of aerospace company Rockwell Collins, now part of RTX (RTX.N), opens new tab, will also talk to suppliers, government officials and regulators. The planemaker is bleeding cash and beset by problems expected to take years to fix.\n\nMAX production and deliveries have slowed following the Jan. 5 mid-air panel blowout on a near-new model, while output of the 787 Dreamliner is now less than five per month due to supply-chain problems.\n\nOrtberg\'s to-do list includes boosting output of MAX jets from about 25 to 38 planes a month by year-end and securing a labor deal to avoid a possible strike this year.\n\nAirline industry executives, while optimistic about Ortberg, are urging him to prioritize plane deliveries, after delays undermined carriers\' planning.\n\n“When I meet him and I ask him one thing, it\'s going to be: \'please deliver my planes on time\',” Etihad Airways CEO Antonoaldo Neves told The National.\n\nOn Wednesday, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said the 737 MAX 9 emergency was entirely avoidable because Boeing had been repeatedly warned about the problem of unauthorized production.',

        'In a reversal, Disney\'s media assets are starting to generate more excitement than its parks',
    content:
        'Here’s a surprise: Disney’s media business isn’t weighing down the company anymore.\n\nThe primary Disney investor narrative since 2022 has been how streaming losses, combined with a declining traditional pay TV business and a string of box office failures, have been anchoring surging sales and profits at the company’s theme parks and resorts. The result has been a company whose shares have fallen about 24% in the past two years, while the S&P 500 has gained 28% in the same period.\n\nThe company’s second-quarter results suggest a shift is happening. Disney’s combined streaming businesses — Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ — turned a quarterly profit for the first time ever, making \$47 million. That’s a significant improvement from losing \$512 million in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nDisney’s theatrical unit is also on a hot streak. “Inside Out 2” became the highest-grossing animated film of all time in recent weeks. “Deadpool & Wolverine” has taken in \$824 million after two weeks of global release. Disney has become the first studio in 2024 to top \$3 billion in worldwide ticket sales.\n\nMeanwhile, Disney saw a “moderation of consumer demand towards the end of [fiscal] Q3 that exceeded our previous expectations” for its theme parks division. That caused shares to slump about 3% in early trading.\n\nDisney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said during his company’s earnings conference call that he expects the momentum for the media business will only gain steam. That’s music to the ears of Wall Street, which wants both growth and profitability.\n\n“We feel very bullish about the future of this business,” Iger said in reference to streaming. “You can expect that it’s going to grow nicely in fiscal 2025.”\n\nIger referenced a planned crackdown on password sharing, which will begin “in earnest” in September, as a tool that will help generate new subscribers and added revenue for the company. A similar effort from Netflix has helped the world’s largest streamer add new customers during the past year.\n\nDisney is also raising prices for its streaming services in mid-October. Most plans for Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ will cost \$1 to \$2 more per month.\n\nIger rattled off a list of movie titles that Disney hasn’t yet released to emphasize the studio’s solid positioning for the rest of 2024 and beyond.\n\n“Let me just read to you the movies that we’ll be making and releasing in the next almost two years,” Iger said. “We have ‘Moana,’ ‘Mufasa,’ ‘Captain America,’ ‘Snow White,’ ‘Thunderbolts,’ ‘Fantastic Four,’ ‘Zootopia,’ ‘Avatar,’ ‘Avengers,’ ‘Mandalorian’ and ‘Toy Story,’ just to name a few. When you think about not only the potential of those in box office but the potential of those to drive global streaming value, I think there’s a reason to be bullish about where we’re headed.”\n\nDisney isn’t de-emphasizing the parks. The company said last year it plans to invest \$60 billion in its theme parks and cruise lines in the next decade. But it’s undoubtedly healthier for the company to persuade investors that the media units aren’t weighing down the share price.\n\nDisney shares dropped Wednesday, likely because investors were focused on the parks. The next step is for shares to rise during a quarterly earnings report because investors are excited about the media units.',

        'E.l.f. Beauty’s growth story is still going.\n\nThe cosmetics retailer on Thursday blew past quarterly estimates again, posting a 50% gain in sales.\n\nThe company’s sales soared to \$324.5 million in its fiscal first quarter, leading it to raise its full-year guidance. That increase follows a staggering 76% jump in the year-ago quarter.\n\nCEO Tarang Amin told CNBC the company saw growth across its categories. He added that its Bronzing Drops serum quickly became a best seller on the company’s website after its launch during the quarter.\n\nHere’s how the cosmetics company performed compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: \$1.10 adjusted vs. 84 cents expected\n\nRevenue: \$324 million vs. \$305 million expected\n\nThe company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended June 30 was \$47.6 million, or 81 cents per share, compared with \$53 million, or 93 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nSales rose to \$324.5 million, up about 50% from \$216.3 million a year earlier.\n\nFollowing quarter after quarter of outsized growth, Wall Street has come to expect a lot from E.l.f. Beauty. Though it raised its guidance Thursday, the outlook still fell flat after such a big first-quarter beat.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, E.l.f. now expects sales of between \$1.28 billion and \$1.3 billion, compared with its previous outlook of \$1.23 billion and \$1.25 billion. Analysts had expected sales guidance of \$1.3 billion, according to LSEG.\n\nThe company now anticipates its adjusted net income will be between \$198 million and \$201 million, compared with a previous outlook of between \$187 million and \$191 million. E.l.f. expects adjusted earnings per share to be between \$3.36 and \$3.41, compared with previous guidance of \$3.20 to \$3.25. Analysts had expected earnings of \$3.42 per share, according to LSEG.\n\nShares fell about 6% in extended trading.\n\nWhen it reported fiscal 2024 results in May, E.l.f. disappointed investors with an outlook that came in below expectations. Sentiment later turned around after its finance chief, Mandy Fields, suggested that the company tends to issue conservative guidance.\n\n“Last year, we started our guidance at 22% to 24% range, ended the year at 77%,” Fields told analysts at the time. “I’m not saying that we’re promising 77% this year for sure. But what I will say is that gives you a little bit of insight into our guidance philosophy.”\n\nOn Thursday, Amin told CNBC that Fields takes a “balanced” approach to guidance and prefers to take things one quarter at a time.\n\n“If you look at our history over the last five years, these 22 quarters, we typically guide lower than where we eventually come out,” said Amin. “We never want to get ahead of ourselves, and overall the strategy has worked just great ... we’re going to take you through what we’re seeing quarter by quarter, and hopefully we continue to kind of beat that.”\n\nHe added that he isn’t concerned about a consumer pullback in the beauty category and remains “bullish” on the broader environment.\n\n“We are hearing kind of in the macro, ‘Hey, is the consumer being choosier?’ I’d say if they are, they’re choosing E.l.f.,” said Amin. “So we’re perhaps differently positioned, and if you look over the last 22 quarters, it didn’t matter what was happening in the category, whether it was the pandemic, whether it was inflationary pressures ... you name it, we’ve performed well throughout that, and I think it really comes down to our fundamental business model and how we’re different.”\n\nE.l.f., a digitally native beauty retailer that was founded in 2004, has gained a newfound relevance among Gen Z and Gen Alpha consumers through marketing that lands with those younger shoppers and meets them where they are on places such as TikTok and Roblox.',
